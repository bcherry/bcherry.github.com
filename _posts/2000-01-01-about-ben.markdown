Ben Cherry is an engineer in San Francisco, CA.  He's worked at Slide, Twitter, tried (and failed!) to do his own startup, and now works as part of a small team on an exciting new startup, mostly writing Ruby and Objective-C.

When he started this blog, he thought he'd be writing a lot about Python, but was surprised to discover that he really likes JavaScript, so he mostly writes about that instead.

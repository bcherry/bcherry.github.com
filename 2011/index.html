  <h1><a href="/2011/4/Replacing-setTimeout-Globally">Replacing `setTimeout` Globally</a></h1>
</header>
  <div class="span-17 last entry">
    <p>Sometimes, you might want to overwrite built-in global methods like <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code>. If you try, you might find that it&#8217;s much harder than you think to accomplish this in every browser, particularly if you ever want to find the originals again. After a lot of painful experimentation, I think I have a definitive solution that works in all browsers with minimal side-effects.</p>

<h2 id='failed_approaches'>Failed Approaches</h2>

<p>I started out with the simple approach:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout = function() {};
// or
window.setTimeout = function() {};</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work in most browsers. However, Internet Explorer 8 and below are not appreciative of this technique. In the first case, IE will actually throw an exception saying <code>&quot;Object doesn&#39;t support this action&quot;</code>. The second option works, but it will only affect the value of <code>window.setTimeout</code>, leaving plain old global <code>setTimeout</code> alone. This is workable, but not ideal. Time to look for another solution.</p>

<h3 id='another_attempt'>Another Attempt</h3>

<p>After speaking with @jcummins about this, we thought about using the <code>var</code> keyword, and seeing if that would help. So that brings me to my next approach:</p>

<pre><code>var setTimeout = function() {};</code></pre>

<p>The good news is that this works across the board! Both <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>window.setTimeout</code> now reference my new function, in all browsers, and you can safely do any assignments needed, no exceptions thrown. But now the question is, where did the original <code>setTimeout</code> go? It&#8217;s not an easy thing to find.</p>

<p>You might try something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>var temp = setTimeout,
    setTimeout = function() {};</code></pre>

<p>Now, you might expect <code>temp</code> to contain the original <code>setTimeout</code>, but it unfortunately will come up <code>undefined</code>. This is due to <a href='http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting'>JavaScript hoisting</a>. I even tried <code>var temp = window.setTimeout</code> first, but the property on <code>window</code> was immediately hoisted on top.</p>

<p>So, I resolved to find another way to get at the original value. After some digging, I discovered a reference to the original <code>setTimeout</code> on the window&#8217;s prototype, which you can access at <code>window.constructor.prototype.setTimeout</code>. Alright! Things are looking good. Unfortunately, things quickly went downhill.</p>

<p>1. In most browsers, <code>window</code> is constructed by a function named <code>&quot;DOMWindow&quot;</code>. That is, <code>window.constructor.name === &quot;DOMWindow&quot;</code>. However, in Safari this is not the case, the <code>constructor</code> property instead references <code>Object</code>. We don&#8217;t have a way to access <code>DOMWindow</code> directly, so we can&#8217;t get to the prototype. Luckily, we can use the ECMAScript 5 <code>__proto__</code> property, and find <code>setTimeout</code> at <code>window.__proto__.setTimeout</code>. So my catch-all became <code>(window.__proto__ || window.constructor.prototype).setTimeout</code>. 2. It turns out Opera has the same problem as Safari, and we can&#8217;t access the correct prototype at <code>window.constructor.prototype</code>. However, it also doesn&#8217;t seem able to access it at <code>window.__proto__</code>, leaving us low on options. More on that in a bit. 3. IE7 and below don&#8217;t have a <code>constructor</code> <em>or</em> a <code>__proto__</code> property on <code>window</code>, and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any other way to get direct access to the window&#8217;s prototype.</p>

<p>At this point, I declared searching for the original copies of <code>setTimeout</code> outside of the global scope a lost cause, and went back to the drawing board. You could, in theory, instantiate a new <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and copy <code>setTimeout</code> from it, but I didn&#8217;t want to introduce that much overhead.</p>

<h2 id='a_solution'>A Solution</h2>

<p>At this point, I figured the best solution would be to circumvent JavaScript&#8217;s hoisting rules. As we know, hoisting occurs immediately after entering an execution context. So, to dodge it, we&#8217;d have to introduce a second execution context. You could do this easily in HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  var temp = setTimeout;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  var setTimeout = function() {};
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>However, I was looking for a pure JS solution. So, after some soul-searching, I decided I&#8217;d pull out <code>eval</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var temp = setTimeout;
eval(&quot;var setTimeout;&quot;);
setTimeout = function() {};</code></pre>

<p>Done and done. The most flexible thing to do is just to quickly fix the inconsistency where IE doesn&#8217;t allow you to overwrite <code>setTimeout</code> directly, and then proceed to do as you need. Here&#8217;s some quick sample code, though you could easily adapt this better into your own project:</p>

<pre><code>var __originals = {
  st: setTimeout,
  si: setInterval,
  ct: clearTimeout,
  ci: clearInterval
};

eval(&quot;var setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval;&quot;);

setTimeout = __originals.st;
setInterval = __originals.si;
clearTimeout = __originals.ct;
clearInterval = __originals.ci;

__originals = undefined;</code></pre>

<p>This snippet will smooth out that inconsistency in Internet Explorer, and allow you to proceed with whatever overrides or replacements you need on those methods. No need to use <code>var</code> again in the future, so you can avoid the hoisting pains. I&#8217;ve tested this in IE6, 7, 8, and 9, as well as Chrome, Safari, Firefox 3/4, and Opera, all on Mac and Windows, and it&#8217;s rock-solid.</p>

<h2 id='update_a_better_solution'>Update! A Better Solution</h2>

<p>After further investigation, helped by many including @angusTweets and @kangax, I have fully uncovered the problem in IE, with an extremely simple and safe solution.</p>

<p>It turns out that the problem is not always present. For instance, open up a brand new, blank window in IE7 or IE8, and try the following in the JS console:</p>

<pre><code>window.setTimeout = 1;
setTimeout; // 1
setTimeout = 2; // 2</code></pre>

<p>But then, try this instead (again, in a fresh window):</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout;
window.setTimeout = 1;
setTimeout; // {...}
window.setTimeout; // 1
setTimeout = 1; // Error</code></pre>

<p>So what&#8217;s going on here? Well, I&#8217;ve come up with a solid theory.</p>

<p>Initially, the property <code>setTimeout</code> exists on the <code>prototype</code> of <code>window</code>, not on <code>window</code> itself. So, when you ask for <code>window.setTimeout</code>, it actually traverses one step on the prototype chain to resolve the reference. Similarly, when you ask for <code>setTimeout</code>, it traverses down the scope chain, then to <code>window</code>, then down the prototype chain to resolve the reference.</p>

<p>I suspect that IE has a built-in optimization where it automatically caches the resolution of implied globals that are discovered all the way down on the prototype of the global object. It would have good reason to do so, as these are commonly requested references, and traversing that chain is costly. However, it must be setting this reference as read-only, since it&#8217;s just a caching optimization. This has the unfortunate side-effect of causing an exception to be thrown when attempting to assign to the reference by using it as an lvalue. The only way to kill this new reference is by using <code>var</code> in the global scope, but this puts us in the hoisting problem. What to do?</p>

<p>Assuming this theory is correct, there&#8217;s actually a simple solution. To prevent this &#8220;optimization&#8221;, we simply need to move the reference one step up the chain, directly onto <code>window</code>. Luckily, this is quite easy:</p>

<pre><code>window.setTimeout = window.setTimeout;</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Assuming you&#8217;ve done this <strong>before</strong> any reference to <code>setTimeout</code> on its own, this will move the reference and completely avoid this problem. You may now safely assign to <code>setTimeout</code> without using <code>var</code>. This works because <code>window.setTimeout</code>, when used as an lvalue (on the left side of the assignment), does not walk the prototype chain, but on the right side, it does. So this will always pull a property out of the prototype chain and put it right on the object. Incidentally, IE exhibits the same problem with every other property on the window prototype, and the same solution will fix them. You can easily find the other properties, but a few of them are <code>alert</code>, <code>attachEvent</code>, <code>scrollTo</code>, <code>blur</code>, and many others.</p>

<p>This solution has been tested in all browsers, has no side effects, and is wonderfully simple. It&#8217;s always nice when things work out that way.</p>

I wanted to provide a rebuttal to the arguments that the hashbang is bad for the Web, based on a lot of discussions we&#8217;ve been having inside Twitter since the #newtwitter project began last summer, and have continued right up until today.</p>

<h2 id='its_not_about_the_hashbang'>It&#8217;s Not About the Hashbang</h2>

<p>The hashbang is in the unfortunate position of being the messenger of a big change that&#8217;s been slowly occurring on the Web in the past few years, and will only continue to pick up steam: many Web domains are now serving <a href='http://itsnat.sourceforge.net/php/spim/spi_manifesto_en.php'>desktop-class applications</a> via HTTP, instead of traditional Web sites. For instance, twitter.com is no longer a collection of Web pages that represent a Web site, but is simply an application that you happen to launch by pointing a browser at <a href='http://twitter.com'>http://twitter.com</a>*. This has many wide-reaching implications, and the hashbang is merely a side-effect. In this way, the hashbang is an easy-to-hate straw-man, whereas the real debate to be had is about this shift towards applications.</p>

<h2 id='why_applications_on_the_web'>Why Applications on the Web?</h2>

<p>Services such as Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, and others have every reason to build rich applications. An application allows an experience that is faster, more seamless, and much better for users than traditional Web sites. However, we do not have to choose to host our apps on the Web, and could easily use other options, such as building a native OS application, or using another cross-platform platform such as Adobe AIR. We all choose Web applications however, because the Web is ubiquitous, well-understood, and mostly superior to other application delivery options.</p>

<p>We get URLs in our Web applications as a legacy of Web sites, and this feature is unique to this class of applications. The power of URLs bring benefits like bookmarks, sharing of application states for free, and search engine indexing. Unfortunately, supporting a standard URL structure for this type of application is not possible in current browsers, without using the URL hash. So, we use the URL hash to take advantage of this sort of thing, but not because we believe our application to be a traditional Web site. We do lose indexability and some other benefits of HTTP we may otherwise have, but these are not losses to our application, since we did not have to use a URL at all. Google has <a href='http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/10/proposal-for-making-ajax-crawlable.html'>thankfully provided</a> <a href='http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html'>an implementation for crawling applications</a>, based on the hashbang, which brings search engine indexing to the URL hash, and is easy enough to implement.</p>

<h2 id='the_tradeoff'>The Tradeoff</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve made a tradeoff, however, in making twitter.com into an application using the hash, which is that it now cannot be both an app and a site at the same time. This capability might not sound compelling, but it is. For instance, browsers without JavaScript cannot access content that has been shared using the URL hash, since that is a marker to the JS app, not to a Web page. In a perfect world, we would have been able to use the original URL structure with the hashes for our application, and served both the site and the app simultaneously. This would be the absolute best thing for users of all kinds, and this debate would not be happening.</p>

<p>There is hope on the horizon, in the form of the HTML5 History API. This new browser feature will allow developers to change the entire URL path and query string without incurring a page refresh. By using this, we could drop the hash, and get all the benefits of traditional Web sites with all the benefits of a desktop-class application. Support for this has been in Chrome and Safari for some time (albeit with <a href='https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42940'>a bug we found</a> (now fixed)), and will arrive in Firefox 4. Internet Explorer currently has no plans to implement this in IE9, which is a shame. Had it not been for the bug we found, we would have shipped #newtwitter with HTML5 History on day one (and in fact, the integration is already built).</p>

<h2 id='the_hashbang_is_a_good_thing'>The Hashbang is a Good Thing</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s not pretty (despite what Google says). But the hashbang is useful. Users benefit from the trend towards full-fledged applications, with increased speed and functionality. URLs are not necessary in this context, but we provide them (via the hash) because they bring tangible benefits for applications. The hashbang also brings a tangible benefit. Someday, we will hopefully be rid of the thing, when HTML5 History (or <a href='http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/7/Saner-HTML5-History-Management'>something like it</a>) is standard in all browsers. The Web application is not going anywhere, and the hash is a fact of life.</p>

For instance, <a href='http://twitter.com/jobs'>twitter.com/jobs</a> is a normal Web page, as is <a href='http://twitter.com/bcherry'>twitter.com/bcherry</a> when viewed logged-out.  We have, however, begun serving an application to logged-in visitors.</em></span>

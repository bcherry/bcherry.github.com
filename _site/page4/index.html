    <div class="span-17 last entry">
        <p>The module pattern is a common JavaScript coding pattern. It&#8217;s generally well understood, but there are a number of advanced uses that have not gotten a lot of attention. In this article, I&#8217;ll review the basics and cover some truly remarkable advanced topics, including one which I think is original.</p>

<h2 id='the_basics'>The Basics</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ll start out with a simple overview of the module pattern, which has been well-known since Eric Miraglia (of YUI) first <a href='http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/'>blogged about it</a> three years ago. If you&#8217;re already familiar with the module pattern, feel free to skip ahead to &#8220;Advanced Patterns&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id='anonymous_closures'>Anonymous Closures</h3>

<p>This is the fundamental construct that makes it all possible, and really is the single <strong>best feature of JavaScript</strong>. We&#8217;ll simply create an anonymous function, and execute it immediately. All of the code that runs inside the function lives in a <strong>closure</strong>, which provides <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>state</strong> throughout the lifetime of our application.</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
	// ... all vars and functions are in this scope only
	// still maintains access to all globals
}());</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>{@class=js inline}()</code> around the anonymous function. This is required by the language, since statements that begin with the token <code>{@class=js inline}function</code> are always considered to be <strong>function declarations</strong>. Including <code>{@class=js inline}()</code> creates a <strong>function expression</strong> instead.</p>

<h3 id='global_import'>Global Import</h3>

<p>JavaScript has a feature known as <strong>implied globals</strong>. Whenever a name is used, the interpreter walks the scope chain backwards looking for a <code>{@class=js inline}var</code> statement for that name. If none is found, that variable is assumed to be global. If it&#8217;s used in an assignment, the global is created if it doesn&#8217;t already exist. This means that using or creating global variables in an anonymous closure is easy. Unfortunately, this leads to hard-to-manage code, as it&#8217;s not obvious (to humans) which variables are global in a given file.</p>

<p>Luckily, our anonymous function provides an easy alternative. By passing globals as parameters to our anonymous function, we <strong>import</strong> them into our code, which is both <strong>clearer</strong> and <strong>faster</strong> than implied globals. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($, YAHOO) {
	// now have access to globals jQuery (as $) and YAHOO in this code
}(jQuery, YAHOO));</code></pre>

<h3 id='module_export'>Module Export</h3>

<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t just want to <em>use</em> globals, but you want to <em>declare</em> them. We can easily do this by exporting them, using the anonymous function&#8217;s <strong>return value</strong>. Doing so will complete the basic module pattern, so here&#8217;s a complete example:</p>

<pre><code>var MODULE = (function () {
	var my = {},
		privateVariable = 1;

	function privateMethod() {
		// ...
	}

	my.moduleProperty = 1;
	my.moduleMethod = function () {
		// ...
	};

	return my;
}());</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we&#8217;ve declared a global module named <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE</code>, with two public properties: a method named <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE.moduleMethod</code> and a variable named <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE.moduleProperty</code>. In addition, it maintains <strong>private internal state</strong> using the closure of the anonymous function. Also, we can easily import needed globals, using the pattern we learned above.</p>

<h2 id='advanced_patterns'>Advanced Patterns</h2>

<p>While the above is enough for many uses, we can take this pattern farther and create some very powerful, extensible constructs. Lets work through them one-by-one, continuing with our module named <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE</code>.</p>

<h3 id='augmentation'>Augmentation</h3>

<p>One limitation of the module pattern so far is that the entire module must be in one file. Anyone who has worked in a large code-base understands the value of splitting among multiple files. Luckily, we have a nice solution to <strong>augment modules</strong>. First, we import the module, then we add properties, then we export it. Here&#8217;s an example, augmenting our <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE</code> from above:</p>

<pre><code>var MODULE = (function (my) {
	my.anotherMethod = function () {
		// added method...
	};

	return my;
}(MODULE));</code></pre>

<p>We use the <code>{@class=js inline}var</code> keyword again for consistency, even though it&#8217;s not necessary. After this code has run, our module will have gained a new public method named <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE.anotherMethod</code>. This augmentation file will also maintain its own private internal state and imports.</p>

<h3 id='loose_augmentation'>Loose Augmentation</h3>

<p>While our example above requires our initial module creation to be first, and the augmentation to happen second, that isn&#8217;t always necessary. One of the best things a JavaScript application can do for performance is to load scripts asynchronously. We can create flexible multi-part modules that can load themselves in any order with <strong>loose augmentation</strong>. Each file should have the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>var MODULE = (function (my) {
	// add capabilities...

	return my;
}(MODULE || {}));</code></pre>

<p>In this pattern, the <code>{@class=js inline}var</code> statement is always necessary. Note that the import will create the module if it does not already exist. This means you can use a tool like <a href='http://labjs.com/'>LABjs</a> and load all of your module files in parallel, without needing to block.</p>

<h3 id='tight_augmentation'>Tight Augmentation</h3>

<p>While loose augmentation is great, it does place some limitations on your module. Most importantly, you cannot override module properties safely. You also cannot use module properties from other files during initialization (but you can at run-time after intialization). <strong>Tight augmentation</strong> implies a set loading order, but allows <strong>overrides</strong>. Here is a simple example (augmenting our original <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE</code>):</p>

<pre><code>var MODULE = (function (my) {
	var old_moduleMethod = my.moduleMethod;

	my.moduleMethod = function () {
		// method override, has access to old through old_moduleMethod...
	};

	return my;
}(MODULE));</code></pre>

<p>Here we&#8217;ve overridden <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE.moduleMethod</code>, but maintain a reference to the original method, if needed.</p>

<h3 id='cloning_and_inheritance'>Cloning and Inheritance</h3>

<pre><code>var MODULE_TWO = (function (old) {
	var my = {},
		key;

	for (key in old) {
		if (old.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
			my[key] = old[key];
		}
	}

	var super_moduleMethod = old.moduleMethod;
	my.moduleMethod = function () {
		// override method on the clone, access to super through super_moduleMethod
	};

	return my;
}(MODULE));</code></pre>

<p>This pattern is perhaps the <strong>least flexible</strong> option. It does allow some neat compositions, but that comes at the expense of flexibility. As I&#8217;ve written it, properties which are objects or functions will <em>not</em> be duplicated, they will exist as one object with two references. Changing one will change the other. This could be fixed for objects with a recursive cloning process, but probably cannot be fixed for functions, except perhaps with <code>{@class=js inline}eval</code>. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve included it for completeness.</p>

<h3 id='crossfile_private_state'>Cross-File Private State</h3>

<p>One severe limitation of splitting a module across multiple files is that each file maintains its own private state, and does not get access to the private state of the other files. This can be fixed. Here is an example of a loosely augmented module that will <strong>maintain private state</strong> across all augmentations:</p>

<pre><code>var MODULE = (function (my) {
	var _private = my._private = my._private || {},
		_seal = my._seal = my._seal || function () {
			delete my._private;
			delete my._seal;
			delete my._unseal;
		},
		_unseal = my._unseal = my._unseal || function () {
			my._private = _private;
			my._seal = _seal;
			my._unseal = _unseal;
		};

	// permanent access to _private, _seal, and _unseal

	return my;
}(MODULE || {}));</code></pre>

<p>Any file can set properties on their local variable <code>{@class=js inline}_private</code>, and it will be immediately available to the others. Once this module has loaded completely, the application should call <code>{@class=js inline}MODULE._seal()</code>, which will prevent external access to the internal <code>{@class=js inline}_private</code>. If this module were to be augmented again, further in the application&#8217;s lifetime, one of the internal methods, in any file, can call <code>{@class=js inline}_unseal()</code> before loading the new file, and call <code>{@class=js inline}_seal()</code> again after it has been executed. This pattern occurred to me today while I was at work, I have not seen this elsewhere. I think this is a very useful pattern, and would have been worth writing about all on its own.</p>

<h3 id='submodules'>Sub-modules</h3>

<p>Our final advanced pattern is actually the simplest. There are many good cases for creating sub-modules. It is just like creating regular modules:</p>

<pre><code>MODULE.sub = (function () {
	var my = {};
	// ...

	return my;
}());</code></pre>

<p>While this may have been obvious, I thought it worth including. Sub-modules have all the advanced capabilities of normal modules, including augmentation and private state.</p>

<h2 id='conclusions'>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Most of the advanced patterns can be combined with each other to create more useful patterns. If I had to advocate a route to take in designing a complex application, I&#8217;d combine <strong>loose augmentation</strong>, <strong>private state</strong>, and <strong>sub-modules</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t touched on performance here at all, but I&#8217;d like to put in one quick note: The module pattern is <strong>good for performance</strong>. It minifies really well, which makes downloading the code faster. Using <strong>loose augmentation</strong> allows easy non-blocking parallel downloads, which also speeds up download speeds. Initialization time is probably a bit slower than other methods, but worth the trade-off. Run-time performance should suffer no penalties so long as globals are imported correctly, and will probably gain speed in sub-modules by shortening the reference chain with local variables.</p>

<p>To close, here&#8217;s an example of a sub-module that loads itself dynamically to its parent (creating it if it does not exist). I&#8217;ve left out private state for brevity, but including it would be simple. This code pattern allows an entire complex heirarchical code-base to be loaded completely in parallel with itself, sub-modules and all.</p>

<pre><code>var UTIL = (function (parent, $) {
	var my = parent.ajax = parent.ajax || {};

	my.get = function (url, params, callback) {
		// ok, so I&#39;m cheating a bit :)
		return $.getJSON(url, params, callback);
	};

	// etc...

	return parent;
}(UTIL || {}, jQuery));</code></pre>

<p>I hope this has been useful, and please leave a comment to share your thoughts. Now, go forth and write better, more modular JavaScript!</p>

    </header>
    <div class="span-17 last entry">
        <p>One particular weirdness and unpleasantry in JavaScript is the set of equality operators. Like virtually every language, JavaScript has the standard <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> operators. However, <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> are NOT the operators most would think they are. These operators do <strong>type coercion</strong>, which is why <code>[0] == 0</code> and <code>&quot;\n0\t &quot; == 0</code> both evaluate to <code>true</code>. This is considered, by sane people, to be a <strong>bad thing</strong>. Luckily, JavaScript does provide a normal set of equality operators, which do what you expect: <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>. It sucks that we need these at all, and <code>===</code> is a pain to type, but at least <code>[0] !== 0</code>.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s all well and good, but when making the decision to use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code> it&#8217;s important to understand if there are any performance implications. Reasonable people, like myself, would expect the strict equality operators to be faster than their type-coercing counterparts, because the type coercion must take time. But, being <a href='http://xkcd.com/242/'>a scientist</a>, I had to set up an experiment to test this hypothesis.</p>

<h2 id='for_science'>For Science!</h2>

<p><a href='http://www.bcherry.net/playground/comparisons'>My experiment</a> times the execution time of 24 different tests, in the browser you view it in. These tests represent every permutation of the following factors:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use</strong>: Whether the result is computed and thrown away, or assigned into a local variable.</li>

<li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Comparing integers vs. integers, strings vs. strings, and integers vs. strings.</li>

<li><strong>Operands</strong>: Whether the operands are actually equal or unequal (with forced type coercion in the case of <code>===</code>).</li>

<li><strong>Operator</strong>: Using either <code>==</code> or <code>===</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I am specifically <strong>not</strong> testing the relative performance when comparing against values like <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, or <code>false</code>. This is because those are falsy values which have even worse type coercion characteristics. Some integers and strings can, of course, also be falsy, such as <code>0</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, but these are normal values which occur during arithmetic or string comparison, so I&#8217;ve tested with them.</p>

<p>The tests were run over two million iterations, except in Internet Explorer, where it produced a long-running script error, so I cut it to 500,000 iterations. Here are the browser configurations I tested:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mozilla Firefox 3.6 (Mac)</li>

<li>Google Chrome 5 (Mac dev channel)</li>

<li>Internet Explorer 8 (iterations reduced by 4x)</li>

<li>Safari 4 (Mac)</li>

<li>Opera 10.5 beta (Mac)</li>

<li>Mozilla Firefox 3.6 (Mac) with Firebug open</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='results'>Results</h2>

<p>My results are <a href='http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=taW8f6kvj3kUVObtg4p9vqQ&amp;output=html'>available as a Google spreadsheet here</a>. It turns out that there is little practical performance difference between <code>==</code> and <code>===</code>. While the strict operator is marginally faster (roughly 10%) in most browsers when combined with explicit type conversion, such as <code>a === +b</code>, the only real performance gains will come from avoiding type conversion entirely. <strong>Converting a string to an integer for comparison with another integer is significantly slower (up to 10x) than simple comparing two integers</strong>. You should never allow integers to be stored as strings internally, as the type conversion will incur a performance penalty.</p>

<p>While that was the basic takeaway from the numbers, I did find one interesting outlier when testing with Firefox. In Firefox, the comparison <code>a === +b</code> is about 20x slower than the equivalent <code>a == b</code> when <code>a</code> is an integer and <code>b</code> is a string integer. This result seems suspicious to me, and nothing similar occurred in any other browser. Oddly, when the Firebug script debugger is turned on, this result changes, and <code>a === +b</code> becomes about 10% faster than the other. I&#8217;m not sure what to make of this result, but it does serve as a reminder that integers should always be stored in numbers, not in strings.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Not much surprise in these results, other than the Firefox result. But, it did help me avoid a nagging worry that I&#8217;m silently slowing down my code whenever I use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code> in my JavaScript.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="span-17 last entry">
        <p>I was talking with a co-worker today about the behavior of <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> when given a small interval, like <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The <em>expectation</em> would be that the timer will fire in 0ms, or 1ms. However, as with <a href='http://wtfjs.com' target='_blank'>other things</a> in JavaScript, the <em>reality</em> is a bit different. It turns out that browsers actually have a <strong>minimum timer interval</strong> which they can&#8217;t work any faster than. John Resig wrote about <a href='http://ejohn.org/blog/analyzing-timer-performance/' target='_blank'>timer performance</a> a few years back, and found this behavior. He&#8217;s also covering it in more detail in his new book.</p>

<p>But, I wasn&#8217;t happy with data a few years old, so I decided to just go and write my own simple test suite, <a href='http://www.bcherry.net/playground/settimeout' target='_blank'>How Fast is setTimeout in Your Browser?</a>. This page simply runs <code>setTimeout</code> with an interval of 0, 1000 times, and averages the <em>real</em> timeout experienced in each. Go ahead and check it out in your browser of choice.</p>

<h2 id='the_results'>The Results</h2>

<p>Well, it turns out that things aren&#8217;t so bad. Most browsers are in the <strong>10-15ms</strong> range for their bottom limit, having improved in recent versions. Notable exceptions are Internet Explorer, which has the same bottom of around <strong>16ms</strong> in all versions since IE6, and Google Chrome, which, at least since version 4, has a bottom limit closer to <strong>5ms</strong> It&#8217;s important to keep this limitation in mind when using <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code>. In particular, if you&#8217;re looking for consistent timer intervals across browsers, you have to use something <strong>&gt;15ms</strong>. But, don&#8217;t forget that JavaScript is single-threaded, and the timer won&#8217;t execute while other code is executing. This means that in the following code sample, you can guarantee that the timer <strong>will not run</strong> until the loop has completed. You cannot, however, guarantee precisely when that will happen, nor that it will be the next piece of code to run following the loop.</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function () { alert(&quot;timer&quot;); }, 0);
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i += 1) {
	// something
}</code></pre>

<p>So it should be safe to use timers with an interval of 0ms when your only expectation is that the timer will fire as soon as it can, but not until after the current code path has completed. Relying on timers to respect the interval you give them is foolish, since, as I&#8217;ve shown, they have a lower-bound, and since they wait even after firing, before executing, for other code to return.</p>

<h2 id='the_source_code'>The Source Code</h2>

<p>This test is really simple. Here&#8217;s the complete JavaScript source code:</p>

<pre><code>var target = document.getElementById(&quot;target&quot;),
	results = 0,
	iterations = 1000,
	i = 0;

function go() {
	var fn = function () {
			results += new Date().getTime() - d;
			i += 1;
			if (i &lt; iterations) {
				go();
			} else {
				finish();
			}
		},
		d = new Date().getTime();
	setTimeout(fn, 0);
}

function finish() {
	target.innerHTML = &quot;Average timer delay was &lt;span class=\&quot;num\&quot;&gt;&quot; + results/iterations + 
		&quot;&lt;/span&gt;ms, over &lt;span class=\&quot;num\&quot;&gt;&quot; + iterations + &quot;&lt;/span&gt; iterations.&quot;;
}

go();</code></pre>

<p>And that&#8217;s all there is to it. I hope you found this useful or interesting. Timers are very fickle, but also incredibly useful, so it&#8217;s worth taking the time to understand what it is they do, and how they do it.</p>
